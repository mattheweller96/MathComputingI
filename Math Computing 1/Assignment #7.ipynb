Terms having zero coefficients are not included. For example, LaTeX: 3x^6-2x^5+6x^2-3 3 x 6 − 2 x 5 + 6 x 2 − 3  is {6:3, 5:-2, 2:6, 0:-3}. Write a function derivative(polynomial) to find the derivative of a polynomial. The input polynomial is a dictionary representing a polynomial. And the function should return a dictionary representing the derivative of the input polynomial. For example, let's revisit the previous example, derivative({6:3, 5:-2, 2:6, 0:-3}) should return {5:18, 4:-10, 1:12} which represents LaTeX: 18x^5-10x^4+12x 18 x 5 − 10 x 4 + 12 x ."
